### Basic working implementation

- The project have a basic structure (componets, helpers, services, viewModels)
- Exist one component and the test like example.
- Exist a service and this service call with fetch the Api urls for boths links
- Implementation of helper to calculate the percentage and the test for this helper.
- Implementation with all logic and avoid logic enerywhere. 

### What you would do differently if this was for real

- Implement axios or another rest client.
- Testing for service.
- Testing for viewModel, I tryed but I need more time to mock the services calls.
- In other word test for all files. Al the time try to coverage the 100%. For Library Upgrades the testing is our best friend.
- Install any intenational library.
- Create a css for each component.
- Install Lint for the project.
- install library for accesibility testing.
- Configure paths in the tsconfig.
